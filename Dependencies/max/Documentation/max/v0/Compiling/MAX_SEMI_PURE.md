# MAX_SEMI_PURE

API version: [**v0**](../../v0.md)

## Note

MAX_SEMI_PURE allows a developer to provide aliasing information to the compiler.
A developer will want to be familiar with [pointer aliasing optimizations](AliasingOptimizations.md) in order to use MAX_SEMI_PURE.

A semi-pure function is one that references or modifies only locals, arguments, and first-level indirections of arguments.
This means param1->foo is okay.
But param1->member1->foo isn't okay. This is a second-level indirection.
A semi-pure function also cannot access globals.

Use [MAX_PURE](MAX_PURE.md) instead if the code does not need to follow first-level indirections.

Use [MAX_PURE_WITH_GLOBALS](MAX_PURE_WITH_GLOBALS.md) instead if the code needs to follow first-level indirections and access globals.

## Example

```c++
template< typename T >
MAX_SEMI_PURE( inline T Max( const T & lhs, const T & rhs ) );
```
